  CFD (Contract for Difference) trading is a financial strategy where traders speculate on price fluctuations of various markets (like stocks, commodities, forex, or cryptocurrencies) without owning the actual asset. In CFD trading, you agree with a broker to settle the difference in the asset's price from the time the position is opened to when it's closed.
